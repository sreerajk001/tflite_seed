## **Crop Prediction App** 🌱📱  

### **Overview**  
The **Crop Prediction App** is a smart and user-friendly mobile application that helps farmers and agricultural enthusiasts determine the best crops to grow based on soil parameters. The app leverages **machine learning** and **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** to predict the top 3 most suitable crops along with their confidence percentages.  

### **Key Features**  

✅ **Smart Crop Prediction:** Uses an advanced ensemble machine learning model (Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree) to suggest the most suitable crops.  
✅ **User-Friendly Input Form:** Users enter key soil parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), pH level, Temperature, Humidity, and Rainfall.  
✅ **Fast & Efficient Processing:** The model runs on-device using **TensorFlow Lite**, ensuring quick predictions without requiring an internet connection.  
✅ **Beautiful & Interactive UI:** The app has a modern and intuitive design with smooth animations, easy-to-use text fields, and well-organized results.  
✅ **Detailed Result Display:** The prediction results are displayed on a separate screen with a visually appealing card format, enhancing readability.  
✅ **Lightweight & Offline Support:** The app is optimized for low-resource environments, allowing farmers in remote areas to benefit from AI-driven crop recommendations.  

### **How It Works**  

1️⃣ **Enter Soil Parameters** – The user inputs seven key parameters related to soil and climate conditions.  
2️⃣ **Predict Best Crops** – The app processes the data using a pre-trained machine learning model and predicts the top 3 suitable crops.  


### **Technology Stack**  

📌 **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart)  
📌 **Backend:** Machine Learning Model (TensorFlow Lite)  
📌 **State Management:** Provider  
📌 **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree  

 

The **Crop Prediction App** is a step towards **smart farming**, enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions and maximize their yield with the power of **AI & machine learning**! 🌿🚜
